/**
 * SegmentBasisFlexureConstraint holds the set of fields needed to characterize a single local linear
 * 	Constraint, expressed linearly as a combination of the local Predictor Ordinates and their corresponding
 *  Response Basis Function Realizations. Constraints are expressed as
 * 
 * 			C := Sigma_(i,j) [W_i * B_i(x_j)] = V where
 * 
 * 	x_j => The Predictor Ordinate at Node j
 * 	B_i => The Coefficient for the Response Basis Function i
 * 	W_i => Weight applied for the Response Basis Function i
 * 	V => Value of the Constraint
 * 
 * SegmentBasisFlexureConstraint can be viewed as the localized basis function transpose of
 *  SegmentResponseValueConstraint.
